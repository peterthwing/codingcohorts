    <h1>About the FTS podcast</h1>
    <p>I love talking. I love listening. I love learning. I love sharing my thoughts and opinions. I also love hearing
        the thoughts and opinions of others. However, many people find themselves with no efficient way of having their
        thoughts and opinions heard by others. Here is where this podcast comes in. The Free to Think and Speak Podcast
        is a place where any guest can come on the podcast and talk about any topic in a open discussion, free from
        judgment and condemnation. Therefore, expect to hear differing opinions on controversial topics. The goal is
        we are better-off for having heard these discussions, and hopefully we've learned something along the way. 
        The purpose behind this open discussion without censorship is to get as much information on the table as possible. 
        The more imformation that is on the table, the more can be included in the brainstorming of possible solutions, 
        and/or all options of paths to take moving forward. This should give us the most likely chance of achieving the 
        best possible outcome. So let's give a nice, warm welcome to this week's guest.</p>
