    <h1>About the FTS podcast</h1>
    <p>I love talking. I love listening. I love learning. I love sharing my thoughts and opinions. I also love hearing
        the thoughts and opinions of others. However, many people find themselves with no efficient way of having their
        thoughts and opinions heard by others. Here is where this podcast comes in. The Free to Think and Speak Podcast
        is a place where any guest can come on the podcast and talk about any topic in a open discussion, free from
        judgment and condemnation. Therefore, expect to hear differing opinions on controversial topics, and hopefully,
        we call all learn something, and be better for having heard these discussions. The idea is: the more imformation
        on the table that can be included in brainstorming possible solutions or optional paths to take moving forward,
        the more likely we are to achieve the best possible outcome.</p>
